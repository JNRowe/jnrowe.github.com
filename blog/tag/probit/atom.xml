&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about the day job is the post-project analysis and
postmortems, which we lovingly refer to as &lt;abbr title=&quot;Project Obituaries&quot;&gt;probits&lt;/abbr&gt;
internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in heavily structured and standalone project-oriented environment.  In
a decade I can count the number of fluid projects on three fingers.  As I write
this in June 2014 my tier-one project started 21 months ago, and has a delivery
date locked down to a week in 2015.  We’ll deliver on time or a touch early, our
team is known for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of working on such strict projects with definite ship dates
and locked schedules is that you always know when a project is complete.  This
also allows us to take advantage of that by inspecting the project as a whole,
spotting the successes and failures within.  Probits are the more informal
dialogue that we pin to the front of each folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-youll-find&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you’ll find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently decided I’d like to take a similar approach to some side projects
that I work on, and also try to apply the methods to some more real-life
situations.  This category, and the accompanying index, below are that attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toctree-wrapper compound&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
