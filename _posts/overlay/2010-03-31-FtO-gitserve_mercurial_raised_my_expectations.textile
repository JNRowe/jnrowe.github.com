Today's package from my "overlay":http://github.com/JNRowe/misc-overlay is "gitserve":http://github.com/jezdez/git-serve/, a web server for viewing "git":http://www.git-scm.com/ repositories that is written in "Python":http://www.python.org/.  It is simply a wrapper around @gitweb@ that doesn't require the user to install a full web server to use.

If, like me, you're a fan of "mercurial":http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ then you'll recognise the description as a clone of the @mercurial serve@ command.

You can find an ebuild for @gitserve@ in "my overlay":http://github.com/JNRowe/misc-overlay/blob/master/dev-vcs/gitserve/gitserve-0.2.0.ebuild, or you can just clone the upstream repository and run it directly.

If you're using my overlay then installation is very simple:

{% highlight text %}
$ sudo emerge gitserve
{% endhighlight %}

To use @gitserve@ you call the @gitserve@ command.  By default it will recursively search from the current directory for @git@ repositories, so it makes more sense to either change to the directory containing the repository you wish to view or supply its location as argument when starting @gitserve@.

{% highlight text %}
$ cd ~/my_git_repository
$ gitserve --browser
$ gitserve ~/my_new_project
{% endhighlight %}

The @--browser@ option tells @gitserve@ to start the HTTP server, and open it in your default browser.  This functionality is provided by Python's "webbrowser module":http://docs.python.org/library/webbrowser.html, so check the documentation to see how your browser is chosen or how to override it.

You can also change the port the server runs on or which host it binds to with command line arguments, see @gitserve --help@ for more information.

In summary, @gitserve@ is great lightweight solution for exploring @git@ repositories.  For me it implements one of my favourite features I was missing from @mercurial@ without needing to install a large web server.
