Paul Kerry rants about his problems with "vim":http://www.vim.org/ over the cooler today, and as a long time @vim@ user I found it hard not to respond to some of the points.

bq. All this mode switching makes it hard to know whether typing "Paul" is going to insert a huge block of code from the ether or insert, you know, "Paul" on the screen.

The point Paul is making is that when he is "normal mode":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#vim-modes, typing the "P" of "Paul" can cause @vim@ to insert a huge amount of text at the cursor.  The text comes from the "unnamed register":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#quote_quote, so it will be whatever potentially very large chunk of text he deleted or "yanked":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#yank last.

If he had just added @set showmode@ to his @~/.vimrc@ he would have a nice @-- INSERT --@ reminder in the bottom of his terminal window when in insert mode, as can be seen in the screenshot on the right.

Another option that I use, combined with <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'showmode'">showmode</a>, is to change the cursor colour when switching to and from @insert@ mode.  This unfortunately doesn't work on all terminal types, which means you have to test them individually and then set appropriate values for <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/term.html#'t_SI'">t_SI</a> and <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/term.html#'t_EI'">t_EI</a> on each terminal type.  An example for "rxvt":http://rxvt.sourceforge.net/ based terminals, including my favourite "rxvt-unicode":http://software.schmorp.de/, is below:

{% highlight vim %}
if &term =~? '^rxvt' && exists('&t_EI')
    let &t_EI="\033]12;red\007"
    let &t_SI="\033]12;green\007"
endif
{% endhighlight %}

I use a green cursor to indicate @insert@ mode, I tried a number of alternatives but found keeping the same cursor colour as my shell sessions was the most useful for me.  You can use any colour your terminal supports, including the extended 256 colour palette.  For more information on accessing the colours from the extended palette see the earlier "uber pink prompts":/2009/09/25/TaD-Uber_pink_prompts.html tip.

You can also use the "InsertEnter":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html#InsertEnter and "InsertLeave":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html#InsertLeave events to call a function when changing mode.  There really is no limit to what kind of notifications you can use with this method.  Taking the idea too far we could use the "awesome":http://awesome.naquadah.org/ notifications from an "earlier tip":/2009/10/04/TaD-Simple_notifications_in_awesome.html to display popups when we change mode:

{% highlight vim %}
au InsertEnter * !echo "notify.start('Insert mode started')" | awesome-client
au InsertLeave * !echo "notify.stop('Insert mode finished')" | awesome-client
{% endhighlight %}

Note that I didn't say it was a good idea, just that it was possible!
