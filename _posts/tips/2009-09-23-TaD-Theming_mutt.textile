Jeff, a work colleague, asks via IRC:

bq. Can I make mutt use a blue statusbar in X and red in console? A different colour would make it easier to read with a transparent urxvt.

"mutt":http://www.mutt.org/ has access to environment variables when reading its configurations files, so setting the theme based on term type is extremely easy.

First separate all your common settings in to one file, say @~/.mutt/colour_defaults.rc@.  Then add your per term settings to a file named @~/.mutt/colour_$TERM.rc@.  Telling mutt to use the correct theme is now as simple as adding the following to your @~/.muttrc@:

{% highlight sh %}
source ~/.mutt/colour_defaults.rc
source ~/.mutt/colour_$TERM.rc
{% endhighlight %}
