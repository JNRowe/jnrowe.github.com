Darren Roberts asks via the EADS Linux list:

bq. In "pidgin":http://pidgin.im/ how can I stop the cursor blinking?

Since we've had our "Jabber":http://xmpp.org/ server set up at the office there have been countless questions about using pidgin to the various lists, and I feel the answer that should often be given is:  Use something else.  There are plenty of other clients available; "empathy":http://live.gnome.org/Empathy is installed on all our Solaris and Linux boxes now, "gossip":http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gossip may already be installed, "emacs-jabber":http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net/ seems popular with many of our "emacs":http://www.xemacs.org/ using developers, "gajim":http://www.gajim.org/ comes recommended by a few users or my favourite "bitlbee":http://www.bitlbee.org/.  Now, with the rant out of the way we can go back to the question at hand...

Cursor blinking is a severe annoyance for some people, and disabling it for GTK+ applications is really quite simple.   If you're a "gnome":http://www.gnome.org/ user then the setting to change blinking is in the keyboard properties dialog that can be found in the system menu.  If you're using "KDE":http://www.kde.org/ you should edit @~/.gtkrc-2.0-kde@.  If you're using neither gnome or KDE you can add a directive to your @~/.gtkrc-2.0@:

{% highlight cpp %}
gtk-cursor-blink = 0
{% endhighlight %}
p>. "Fork this code":http://gist.github.com/200429

If it is just rate of blinking that bugs you there is @gtk-cursor-blink@, it should be set to a value in milliseconds to adjust the blink frequency.

If you wish to only change the settings in pidgin you can edit @~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0@ instead of your main @~/.gtkrc-2.0@

h3. Bonus related tip

If you're really driven mad by the blinking cursor, and wish to disable it in the console too then add the next little snippet to your shell's startup file:

{% highlight bash %}
echo -e '\033[?48c'
{% endhighlight %}
