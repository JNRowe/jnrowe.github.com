People, mostly named Neil Blake, who shouldn't look over my shoulder ask:

bq. How do you make "awesome":http://awesome.naquadah.org/ use _purdy_ pixmap backgrounds for the "wibox":http://awesome.naquadah.org/doc/api/modules/wibox.html ?

Simple answer today: cheat.

As you can see in the screenshot on the right my wibox appears to be using the same fancy pixmap background as the "GTK+":http://www.gtk.org/ theme I'm using.  What is actually happening is that I've pasted a copy of the background pixmap from the expose theme on top of my wallpaper using "ImageMagick":http://www.imagemagick.org/index.php, which is easily achievable on a netbook without having to fire up the "gimp":http://www.gimp.org/.

{% highlight sh %}
convert /home/jay/.themes/expose/gtk-2.0/bc.xpm -scale 1024x20! bc.png
composite  -gravity north bc.png backdrop.png backdrop_new.png
{% endhighlight %}

The initial @convert@ command resizes @bc.xpm@ from the expose theme to 1024x20 pixels, 1024 being the screen width and 20 being the height of my main wibox in awesome.  We must suffix the @-scale@ option's argument with @!@ to tell @convert@ to ignore the image's aspect ratio when resizing, without this the command will not produce an image at the size we expect.

The second command tells ImageMagick's @composite@ that we wish to paste our newly generated image on top @backdrop.png@, we could specify any location we want with the @-gravity@ option but I have my wibox on the top of the screen so @north@ is correct for me.

With that done we have an image with our normal wallpaper and wibox sized chunk with our theme's background.  All we need to do now is tell awesome to make our wibox transparent and the final result is a wibox that appears to be using the theme's background.

{% highlight lua %}
mywibox[s] = wibox({ position = "top", fg = beautiful.fg_normal, bg = "#00000000" })
{% endhighlight %}

Colours are specified in the de facto standard format of @#(red)(green)(blue)(alpha)@, the '00' value for alpha in the above example means we want a fully transparent theme background.  You could include some colour values and varying levels of alpha transparency to tint the background image, however that could also be achieved with ImageMagick when building the background image if it is desired.
