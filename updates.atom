&lt;h1&gt;Burning down the streets&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/metro_city.html#burning-down-the-streets class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=epigraph&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole thing makes me wonder whether a modern reintroduction of the
&lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charivari class="reference external"&gt;skimmington ride&lt;/a&gt; for social media is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=attribution&gt;—Stephen Roberts, eloquent friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago a work colleague asked if I could help his wife with an art
project she was working on.  The premise was simple and rather enticing, so
I jumped at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea was to mine Twitter for its copious poison and visualise any
patterns that emerge.  We quickly hit upon the idea that some poison was so
obvious that &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; the Twitter folks would acknowledge and reject it, and
piggybacking off of that would trim down the work considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=mining-the-abyss class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mining the abyss&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/metro_city.html#mining-the-abyss class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My task was simple: ingest a massive lump of &lt;abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"&gt;JSON&lt;/abbr&gt;, process it &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; and spit out results that could be used in an
artsy manner that I would likely not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial concept worked by scanning a firehose of tweets for keywords which
seemed likely to be hugely poisonous, and then create a &lt;abbr title="Directed Acyclic Graph"&gt;DAG&lt;/abbr&gt; as the basis to rate users who were retweeting them.  Later
versions were self-training using a naïve Bayes classifier, which allowed us to
find offensive tweets using words I was previously happily unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on it became obvious that another effect presented itself.  There were
&lt;em&gt;masses&lt;/em&gt; of users who were retweeting users who would later be banned, and
those retweeting users would move on to retweeting new users who themselves
would often end up banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=https://jnrowe.github.io/_images/final_plight.png class=align-right alt="Route of evil"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting point to me was that there were large numbers of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; users
— not bots — who redirect the hate storm and almost nothing else.  Many of
these users were in an anechoic chamber, sucking in tweets from many users and
spitting them back out to virtually no one.  I thought it would be interesting
to work only on the final nodes; weighted by those users who receive close to
no retweets and low user interaction but with histories of retweeting large
numbers of banned and suspended users.  I called it RageRank, because I’m aware
of &lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagerank class="reference external"&gt;Page Rank&lt;/a&gt; and lack an imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arty part of the project became known informally as Final Spite, after an
early visualisation effort with animated clone after clone walking along
a &lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight class="reference external"&gt;Final Fight&lt;/a&gt; background spewing a tweet bubble as their energy bar
depleted.  Each new visualisation started from a map, much like the game’s
levels, and showed a real city with its real occupants.  The intent was to
allow people to experience a location they knew but with its foetid underbelly
exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight class="reference external image-reference"&gt;&lt;img style="width: 237.60000000000002px; height: 158.4px;" src=https://jnrowe.github.io/_images/final_fight_one.png class=align-right alt="Final Fight One on the GBA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=what-happened-next class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened next?&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/metro_city.html#what-happened-next class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next saddened and surprised me in equal quantities; visitors to
the site doxxed a heap of the displayed retweeters almost immediately.  So much
in fact that the site was taken down within a day, and the work became a mostly
offline exhibit in a little gallery for other evening school art students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand the sentiment in many ways, and perhaps should have seen it
coming.  When I saw people I knew in a visualisation I was ashamed, truly
ashamed.  I mean not to the point of thinking it is appropriate to post all
their personal details for the internet vigilantes, but enough that I knew
I would not want to be linked to them through work or social circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the end result was really neat even on the smaller canvas it has to
live on.  Seeing that level of vitriolic rage is not fun, but realising that
much of it is vented in to nowhere does soften it a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=sidebar&gt;
&lt;p class=sidebar-title&gt;Alternative mappings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen the tweets of someone I know pop up, and digging around a little
to see how hateful those tweets were it became clear there was an equally
toxic topic that could be mapped in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the game theme, perhaps a &lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Sands_of_Time class="reference external"&gt;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt;
affair that shows the changing hopes, dreams and promises of the anechoic
brexit promoters from early 2016 up to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=fall-out class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fall out&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/metro_city.html#fall-out class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that surprised me most was that initially I had primed the
data by looking at users who followed users that have been suspended or banned.
After digging in to a few examples to verify the method’s efficacy I noticed
that there are bidirectional follows to the final nodes where one user appears
to be the polar opposite of the other, almost in an &lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Garnett class="reference external"&gt;Alf Garnett&lt;/a&gt; versus
&lt;a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppa_Pig class="reference external"&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/a&gt; scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to think of a possible cause — beyond a simple modelling
error — that could explain this.  Sadly after recognising a top five rage
retweeter in a local town it became somewhat obvious, there are occasionally
business and familial ties involved.  There are seemingly swathes of the
populace who choose to accept public association with the caustic members of
society, even when there is a simple unfollow button you can hit to distance
yourself from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be frank and honest for a moment.  You’re giving the appearance of tacit
approval to people’s views when you continue to follow them, even if you’re not
actively engaging with them.  The simple act of not confronting them is
normalising the behaviour.  If you’re not calling them out on it, you’re doing
yourself and society at large a serious injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</summary></entry><entry><title>&lt;strong class="command"&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; experiments</title><link href="https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div id=fossil-experiments class=section&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; experiments&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#fossil-experiments class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons we can no longer use GitHub at work for any project
which isn’t Open Source.  And since that decision was thrust upon us we’ve been
playing with some alternatives for our workflow.  We’ll probably end up choosing
one of the self hosted clones at some point, but it was decided early on that we
should evaluate a variety of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tasked with testing out &lt;a href=http://www.fossil-scm.org/ class="reference external"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt; on a couple of small side projects, and
these are my &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; biased personal findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I start I should add that while what I’m about to write probably sounds
harsh, I do like &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; the concept.  I like the single &lt;a href=http://sqlite.org/ class="reference external"&gt;sqlite&lt;/a&gt;
project repository, I like the small-enough-to-grok-in-an-afternoon code base
and I like the idea of a totally reproducible project state including all
metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=testing-fossil class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#testing-fossil class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that testing &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; is a piece of cake.  It
supports both reading and writing &lt;strong class=command&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;a href=http://git-scm.com/docs/git-fast-import class="reference external"&gt;fast-import&lt;/a&gt; format.  If you
want to test it out just dump an existing &lt;a href=http://www.git-scm.com/ class="reference external"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; repository(or &lt;a href=http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/FastImportExtension class="reference external"&gt;mercurial with an
extension&lt;/a&gt;), and feed it &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil import&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you later change your
mind you can run &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil export&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly supporting incremental two-way mirroring didn’t work out for us, but
perhaps it will for simpler projects.  In the end I simply mirrored the
&lt;strong class=command&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; repositories to &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;, marked the &lt;strong class=command&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt;
repositories as read-only and forced contributors to work with
&lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=packaging class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Packaging&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#packaging class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; project sells itself on being a single file binary
install, and that probably works well for a subset of users.  We’re not that in
that subset though, and &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; is more than a little annoying to
wrangle in to our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tarball ships without any &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; usable documentation, so you end up
with either no system documentation or a collection of docs sprinkled with wiki
markup in &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;/usr/share/doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; builds in a manner which breaks most packaging
standard unfortunately.  If you’re building packages you’ll likely need to
write an awful lot of custom workarounds to get a compliant and usable package,
see &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;lst-pkgs/utils/dev/fossil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; build for the gory details of our hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=uptake class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uptake&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#uptake class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really want to hold this against &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
important to note that for all intents and purposes no one is familiar with it.
No upstream projects we actively track use it, there isn’t a single person who
chooses to use it on our site(which is why I had to handle the packaging) and
expecting new hires to have even heard of it is probably a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be such an issue if the choice was a &lt;strong class=command&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; vs &lt;a href=http://mercurial.selenic.com/ class="reference external"&gt;mercurial&lt;/a&gt;
one, where the few differences are mostly cosmetic.  &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; is
a completely different beast, and requires an enormous rethink in the way you
handle version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago when people were on the whole still familiar with the &lt;abbr title="Concurrent Versions System"&gt;CVS&lt;/abbr&gt; and
Subversion way of working that wouldn’t have been such an issue, but times have
most definitely changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary in the documentation is likely to be foreign to users of any
version control system, and the workflow examples in the documentation are
entirely foreign to how we have developed any project in at least the past
decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=all-in-one-solution class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All-in-one solution&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#all-in-one-solution class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the proclaimed benefits of using &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; is that it handles
many aspects of a project’s &lt;abbr title="Application Lifecycle Management"&gt;ALM&lt;/abbr&gt;; version control, issue tracking,
documentation(via a wiki), etc.  However, and this is only my opinion, it feels
like it does of all of these in a suboptimal manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=version-control class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Version control&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#version-control class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version control feels quite nice for the most part, definitely usable but
a little annoying to work with if you’re used to a modern &lt;abbr title="Distributed Version Control System"&gt;DVCS&lt;/abbr&gt; like we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said it does feel like a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; step backwards when working with branches,
and you should set aside quite a lot of time for integration issues when you
have &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;autosync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; disabled.  And I can’t imagine a scenario where &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;autosync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
could work for us, without rewriting our entire way of working or returning to
&lt;abbr title="Concurrent Versions System"&gt;CVS&lt;/abbr&gt;-style mega commits and a manual patch stack layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;a href=http://www.bugzilla.org class="reference external"&gt;Branching, Forking, Merging, and Tagging&lt;/a&gt;
documentation it appears that this is a design feature for the creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=issue-tracker class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Issue tracker&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#issue-tracker class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue tracker feels like someone has tried to improve on &lt;a href=http://www.bugzilla.org class="reference external"&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;, without
taking a look at modern trackers.  It is definitely the weakest part of
&lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; in my opinion, using it is both a mental and eye-stabbing
pain at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily you can rework a lot of it by fiddling around with the administration
settings exposed by &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil ui&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also exposes one of the best features of &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;, you can create
a custom &lt;abbr title="Structured Query Language"&gt;SQL&lt;/abbr&gt; script that configures the project(issue tracking, pretty theme,
etc) and just blast it in to the project’s database.  Or you can create
a custom file that makes all your edits and pump it in with &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil
config import&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=wiki class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wiki&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#wiki class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiki system is actually really good for what it does, but it has very few of
the features we use for our documentation.  I don’t want to hold that against it
though, as it just a impedance mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of the integrated components feels to me like you’ve chosen
a usable, but weak, component for some of the  most important parts of your
project’s &lt;abbr title="Application Lifecycle Management"&gt;ALM&lt;/abbr&gt;.  The bits work well together, but none of them seem like an
option you’d choose on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=interface class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interface&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#interface class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The help output for new users is, in my opinion, really irritating.  The default
command message tells you to run &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil help&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil
help COMMAND&lt;/strong&gt;, without providing the names of any of the common commands.  The
&lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil help&lt;/strong&gt; output emulates a &lt;strong class=command&gt;tsort&lt;/strong&gt; filter of the command
names, listing commands with unique to &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; terminology and no
short descriptions.  &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil help --all&lt;/strong&gt; feels like it should be more
useful, but just creates a larger table of commands with uncommon names and
still no descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes very little sense to organise the help in this manner because as you
get used to the naming and non-standard option style you will need the help
less.  I’ve patched this for our packages, and if people like it I’ll try to
push it upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class=admonition-title&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out I won’t be pushing the changes upstream.  They require
a &lt;abbr title="Contributor License Agreement"&gt;CLA&lt;/abbr&gt; that I can not sign in good faith, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option handling &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; trip you up endlessly.  Just the little things like
being unable to chain options, and needing an endless stream of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;C-p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=pre&gt;M-5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=pre&gt;M-b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=pre&gt;&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to add a space before a commit message for example.  Yes, I know some
people don’t like standard &lt;strong class=command&gt;getopt&lt;/strong&gt; or GNU-style option parsing, but
every other tool you use has chosen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the interface decisions are actively bad, for example there appears to
be no way to delegate password configuration to a trusted system service or even
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;netrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Specifying passwords in &lt;abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"&gt;URL&lt;/abbr&gt;s on the command line is a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;
anti-pattern, and I just hope you don’t have any multiseat systems if you’re
using that method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=speed class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speed&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#speed class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; is fast, not &lt;strong class=command&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; fast but fast
nonetheless.  Commits do take a disturbingly long time to complete for some
reason, but most of the other commands are fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangling a repository is actually a lot faster with &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; than any
other system I can think of, as you can just throw the power of &lt;abbr title="Structured Query Language"&gt;SQL&lt;/abbr&gt; at it.
You can find some &lt;a href=http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ class="reference external"&gt;sqlalchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;abbr title="Object relational mapping"&gt;ORM&lt;/abbr&gt;
definitions in &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;/usr/share/doc/fossil/orm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in my packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=conclusion class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/fossil.html#conclusion class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in this first paragraph, but I don’t see us moving to
&lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is a nice system, but it just wouldn’t work for us as
is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me is tempted to attempt to fix the problems, but then we’d be left with
a system that is more obscure than &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you read the &lt;a href=http://fossil-scm.org/xfer/doc/tip/www/concepts.wiki class="reference external"&gt;Fossil
Concepts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=http://www.fossil-scm.org/xfer/doc/tip/www/faq.wiki class="reference external"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt; documents you’ll see that the most
significant problems for us are actually features for upstream, and that is
obviously fine but it does mean upstreaming changes would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class=admonition-title&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above, it turns out they require a &lt;abbr title="Contributor License Agreement"&gt;CLA&lt;/abbr&gt; which means we couldn’t
send changes upstream anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said I’m am planning on stealing some of the ideas that I really liked
about &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil&lt;/strong&gt; for my own use.  &lt;strong class=command&gt;fossil all&lt;/strong&gt;’s ability to run
a command against all repositories configured in &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;~/.fossil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I’ve taken to having routine breaks from certain
timesinks to help me focus and also to denoise some of my thoughts.  The number
one timesink in my world is without doubt the interwebs, and there are a few
steps I’ve taken to weaken its stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the following will help you, or perhaps you’ll &lt;a href=mailto:jnrowe%40gmail.com class="reference external"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; me to point out
your ideas for me to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I track every thing that I &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; can, doing so can be very empowering.
This is something which the buzzwordy types apparently refer to as The
Quantified Self, and despite knowing that I continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a query of my network logs&lt;a id=id1 href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#s1 class="footnote-reference brackets"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I can tell you that for the first nine
months of this year I’ve been entirely without internet access for thirty-one
percent of the time.  Last year the final amount was thirty-eight percent, and
once our Winterval shutdown is included I’d expect this year to be about the
same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just a case of being without internet access for a few hours or on
certain days either, my longest &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; break this year was a straight
thirteen days back in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one thing I’ve learnt is that a lot of the things I burnt time on
were genuinely just burnt.  For example, news sites feel mostly pointless to
me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=simple&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular news sources are invariably a PR copy’n’paste fest, which is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
noticeable when you come back from a break and catch up on various feeds in
one huge chunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites with a slightly more tech bias like HackerNews and its ilk are just
a complete time hole.  Often the really interesting tech stories will bubble
up elsewhere in a curated fashion(such as &lt;a href=http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/ class="reference external"&gt;Trivium&lt;/a&gt;), and for example on HN the
majority of posts and comments are just US politics or occasionally
interesting insights from the SV bubble anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll still catch up from a couple of, in my opinion, trusted sources.  That is
to say I’ll dip in to a few categories on &lt;abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation"&gt;BBC&lt;/abbr&gt; news and perhaps visit The Guardian’s site(although I do that
considerably less over the past year according to my data).  I also like to
avail myself of a little &lt;a href=http://rt.com/ class="reference external"&gt;Russia Today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=http://www.aljazeera.net/ class="reference external"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; to keep the bias in
check a touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a simple &lt;a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdial class="reference external"&gt;rdial&lt;/a&gt; report I can also tell you that on an average
internet connected day I can spend an hour reading news, friend’s blogs, sports
stories, &amp;amp;c.  A big chunk of that time is also combined with breakfast, so
I choose to let it slide for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=tighten-the-noose class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tighten the noose&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#tighten-the-noose class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the two-thirds of the year that I have internet access, I’ve started to
severely restrict access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a friend who — while wearing his tinfoil hat — preached
about how we all need to consider blocking sites that use &lt;abbr title="Content Delivery Network"&gt;CDNs&lt;/abbr&gt; in much the
same way that many of us block web analytics companies.  We’re probably giving
up more tracking data to the large &lt;abbr title="Content Delivery Network"&gt;CDNs&lt;/abbr&gt;s then we do to the simple analytics
companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought popped in to my mind that a whitelist, instead of a blacklist, might
actually be workable and since last November I’ve taken to doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strangest result in my mind is just how short the list is.  My old advert
and analytics blacklist had close to 1500 entries, and would obviously miss many
”nasties” that I either hadn’t seen or that were simply new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whitelist, on the other hand, has only ever had 900 entries. Right now it
has less than 150 thanks to the automated decay-based-on-visits purging of the
entries it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whitelist approach also feeds in to my data tracking habit, as I can now
tell from the decay tracking data when bursts of certain sites appear.  For
example, StackOverflow(and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;cdn.sstatic.net/stackoverflow/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for styling) was
on the whitelist for two weeks in June with six visits, which happens to
coincide with a project that involved porting a tool to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of using a whitelist makes the point of procrastination noticeable and
adds a cost to even starting it.  Every time I want to visit a new site&lt;a id=id2 href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#s2 class="footnote-reference brackets"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,
I have to highlight the &lt;abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator"&gt;URL&lt;/abbr&gt; and rattle a key combo in &lt;a href=http://awesome.naquadah.org/ class="reference external"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; that updates
the whitelist to enable access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=on-the-knoll class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the knoll&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#on-the-knoll class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the whole “go without the internet” thing is going to strike people as
unworkable.  Questions abound about contact via email, missing bug reports,
skipping meeting logs, depriving myself of invites to weddings I don’t wish to
attend and so on.  I do realise it isn’t achievable for everyone, but with
a little effort it should at the very least be achievable for one day a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other advantage of doing so is the forced removal from services that
actively destroy your privacy and the privacy of your friends and family, which
is something that feels increasingly important in recent years.  For example,
I no longer actively store my addressbook online&lt;a id=id3 href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#s3 class="footnote-reference brackets"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; nor do I use a service
to help me process receipts any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=sidebar&gt;
&lt;p class=sidebar-title&gt;Admission of guilt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I haven’t quite dropped all the services I’d like to,
here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=simple&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strava - I’m still kind of using for the time being, although Keith’s
replacement looks like it will fulfil my needs &lt;abbr title="Real Soon Now™"&gt;RSN&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;status.net - There are one or two people I don’t want to lose contact with
who aren’t able to access our private server because of geo-filtering, and
I don’t know how that can be fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of benefits to dropping the reliance on &lt;abbr title="Software as a Service"&gt;SaaS&lt;/abbr&gt; affairs.  The chance of any of them existing tomorrow is frankly
not all that great: shuttering, buy-out closures, “pivoting”, &amp;amp;c.  You can
also retain some level of control over your own data, knowing that for example
it isn’t being sold or stored in regions with little to no data protection
regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I — no, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; — should have resisted the urge to use so called
cloud services from the outset.  One doesn’t need to be a fully paid up member
of the tinfoil hat brigade to know that it is just not acceptable to entrust
your important data to external companies for the sake of a little convenience
or a shiny interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing my internet access for chunks of time really pointed out how much I had
come to rely on services far beyond my control, and the freedom one feels when
you regain some of that is very comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=rubric&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt id=s1 class=label&gt;&lt;span class=brackets&gt;&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#id1 class=fn-backref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code I use is an unreleased project created by a friend, but
&lt;a href=http://humdi.net/vnstat/ class="reference external"&gt;vnstat&lt;/a&gt; may work equally well for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt id=s2 class=label&gt;&lt;span class=brackets&gt;&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#id2 class=fn-backref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part I whitelist based on hostname, but as in the
StackOverflow styling example will whitelist specific paths on hosts on some
occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt id=s3 class=label&gt;&lt;span class=brackets&gt;&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/disconnect.html#id3 class=fn-backref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m aware that Google has access to a small corner of my contacts graph
via gmail, but I haven’t yet decided how I plan to resolve.  I’ve never used
gmail for work or mail that I’d be uncomfortable reading in public, but it
does act as a nice sieve for everything else right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Open Source and enjoyment&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#open-source-and-enjoyment class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I burned out on Open Source projects, to the point that it was
close to impacting other parts of my life.  I have only myself to blame as
I didn’t manage to distance myself at all well.  Distancing yourself is not easy
to do when your fun hobby for relaxation is the thing that is working against
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a variety of incredibly minor issues that piled up Jenga-style.  Then
to carry the weak analogy forward, it toppled over in a split second like Jenga
in a rubber dingy on the rolling seas with a fumbling drunken friend wearing
a blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to write down a few of the things that were happening, both as an
act of catharsis and to help me spot the problems in future.  Perhaps it will
help others who are experiencing the same thing but haven’t quite spotted the
catalysts yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=dealing-with-needy-users class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with needy users&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#dealing-with-needy-users class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users seem to feel a disproportionate amount of “you work for me”,
seemingly more so than happens with actual paying customers on other projects
which strikes me as strange.  They’ll bug you endlessly in emails, in the issue
tracker, on &lt;abbr title="Internet Relay Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/abbr&gt; and in real life if you end up at the same conference.  You
&lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to stop this before it takes hold.  It helps if you can be polite, but
if not just stop it anyway.  It is for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; welfare, so just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually found myself burning the wrong people towards the peak of that
imaginary Jenga tower.  You need to make a concerted effort to figure out which
people are delivering the seemingly endless grief or perhaps just relentless
&lt;a href=http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bikeshedding class="reference external"&gt;bikeshedding&lt;/a&gt;, and stop them.  It is all too easy to accidentally become
annoyed at well meaning useful contributors when you’ve been trawling through
a heap of useless meta-discussion about a change nobody is making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; project I worked on there was a user who didn’t read the
documentation, couldn’t use the language enough to write tests, yet still
endlessly sucked up support time by opening awful issues and sending pointless
emails wishing to discuss changes they might make.  I kind of hesitate to say
awful issues, but - for example - if you can’t write a two line assertion in
a language you’re not in the target audience for a library in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those people aren’t even adding value in pointing out deficiencies in
documentation, because they’re not a target user.  It would be like me writing
to &lt;a href=http://www.jcb.com/ class="reference external"&gt;JCB&lt;/a&gt; telling them they must document why they use round knobs on the digger
I saw someone else using.  So try spot it early, and put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect a big part of the issue here is cost.  I’m sure if there was even
a single penny cost to opening issues or sending a mail it would do wonders for
communication in general.  I suspect that would remain true even if you
reimbursed that penny immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=the-answer class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The answer&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#the-answer class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured out how to work with this entirely by accident.  Politely offer
answers that move them away from you.  It is by far the easiest solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one instance I suggested alternative packages to an expensive user, with the
hope they’d quietly move on.  Which is evil really, as what you’re really doing
is dreaming that they’ll move on to bother a developer who isn’t you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I stole an idea from a friend and said “Sorry, I can’t
figure out how to implement this.  Open a pull request, and I’ll merge it!” to
another.  It worked well, because it stopped the direction-less discussion and
was never going to be followed up with a patch later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=dealing-with-unreasonable-requests class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with unreasonable requests&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#dealing-with-unreasonable-requests class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to get quite annoyed when I received an impolite or unreasonable request
on an Open Source project, nowadays I tend to just respond with pre-canned
answers for most of them.  If you can cut the time it takes to respond to them,
you’ll obviously spend far less time thinking about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical one that springs to mind is a user complaining that you’ve not
licensed your &lt;abbr title="GNU General Public License"&gt;GPL&lt;/abbr&gt; code in a way which allows them to use it without
contributing anything in return.  I choose reciprocating licences where I can,
because frankly that may be the only value you provide &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; as a user.  I get
that some people need to use their Open Source projects as a way to improve
their CV or build a presence, but for many of us it is just for fun and
reciprocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that I recall, but wish I didn’t, was a user &lt;em&gt;telling&lt;/em&gt; me to
recompress a tarball on &lt;abbr title="Python Package Index"&gt;PyPI&lt;/abbr&gt; because their infrastructure couldn’t support
&lt;strong class=command&gt;bzip2&lt;/strong&gt;.  Seems reasonable enough, but it came wrapped in a tirade of
abuse.  I ignored the abuse, uploaded another tarball and then received another
abusive email in return the next day.  That was a long time ago, far before the
burnout started to creep in so I just addressed the actual issue and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=id1 class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The answer&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#id1 class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten about that whole previous story until at &lt;a href=https://europython.eu/ class="reference external"&gt;Europython&lt;/a&gt; a friend
was telling me about someone who was banned from a number of events, hell-banned
on various mailing lists and on forced lockout on Stack Overflow for poisonous
behaviour.  I started to tell my story as an example of strange abusive
behaviour, and it turned out to be the same guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is these people can be everywhere so just don’t let them get to you.
I realise that is both obvious and feels hard to do, but it is quite easy in the
virtual world.  If you have the hell-ban option available just use
it; perhaps there is an ignore option in your issue tracker, add a “send to
trash” rule in your email filter.  Even in person it can be quite easy to do,
just politely acknowledge their issue and move away instead of engaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=the-solutions class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solutions&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/burn_out.html#the-solutions class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose a solution I hate, for all intents and purposes I don’t release new Open
Source projects any longer.  I still work on a lot of projects, and the code is
normally available somewhere for strangers.  However, for the most part I’ve
made a point of not hosting or releasing it in the common places.  This works
for me, but it saddens me deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who does something interesting to combat the same problems I’ve
mentioned here.  He hooks the issue tracker to only show issues reported by
people in his second-degree &lt;a href=http://www.foaf-project.org/ class="reference external"&gt;FOAF&lt;/a&gt; circle or people whose user profile is an
active Open Source contributor.  It works, and it cuts out most of the problem
users, but it is nasty.  I feel it is worse than my “solution” because it still
gives the impression of support to the users you won’t support, but also gives
the impression of bad support through heaps of unanswered issues to the users
who would receive good support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing users they had skin
in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be misappropriating a quote from a great film there, but it is important.
A lot of the actively poisonous people who contact you aren’t providing any real
value to you, and they’re probably never going to.  If you can remove them
somehow you’re probably not losing anything, but you’ll be gaining a whole lot
personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;ebuild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; files with no overall theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Too Long; Didn’t Read"&gt;TLDR&lt;/abbr&gt;; For what it was &lt;a href=https://github.com/JNRowe/jnrowe-misc class="reference external"&gt;jnrowe-misc&lt;/a&gt; served its
purpose well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=an-island-unto-itself class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An island unto itself&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/probits/jnrowe-misc.html#an-island-unto-itself class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may come as a surprise to a few of the users(which would be most of
them) the overlay available on GitHub wasn’t the deliverable at any point in
time.  In fact, the often convoluted merge history in the repository probably
hinted at that quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/_images/jnrowe-misc.png class="reference internal image-reference"&gt;&lt;img style="width: 50%;" src=https://jnrowe.github.io/_images/jnrowe-misc.png class=align-right alt="Tree view of ``jnrowe-misc`` history"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;jnrowe-misc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was always the combination of a few independently managed
repositories that I bundled up to make available for public consumption.
Eventually it ended up being mostly Python stuff, but that was because the
support burden of other packages was becoming more time consuming than I could
justify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; audience for the overlay, my co-workers, saw a different beast
entirely.  It used our keyword types and rules, it came bundled &lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/tdd_distros.html class="reference internal"&gt;&lt;span class=doc&gt;with the
tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was unable to share and had a tighter schedule for
maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I received a fair number of emails and live comments from users so I’ll
call that a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=upstreamed class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upstreamed&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/probits/jnrowe-misc.html#upstreamed class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, very little was ever taken upstream(even less if you count the parts that
were credited).  This was entirely my fault.  I originally started exporting the
overlay because I was fed up with the new package process upstream, and it seemed
like the best way to deal with that for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that some packages would be picked up, but didn’t actively push them
after the first few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlay should have never touched packages that were available upstream, but
occasionally they overlapped when upstream added them.  The use of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;::shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
to workaround problems when new packages were added upstream worked &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
well, and saved the few remaining hairs on my balding head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=legacy class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/probits/jnrowe-misc.html#legacy class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the majority of packages will continue to be maintained for the
foreseeable future, but regrettably it looks like the result will not be
available beyond a “open to all people who know where to look” organisation on
GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to change the new maintainer’s mind, but in all honesty I understand
their reasons.  I’ve stopped maintaining a lot of once public projects over the
past couple of years, and it is as refreshing as it is saddening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about the day job is the post-project analysis and

internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in heavily structured and standalone project-oriented environment.  In
a decade I can count the number of fluid projects on three fingers.  As I write
this in June 2014 my tier-one project started 21 months ago, and has a delivery
date locked down to a week in 2015.  We’ll deliver on time or a touch early, our
team is known for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of working on such strict projects with definite ship dates
and locked schedules is that you always know when a project is complete.  This
also allows us to take advantage of that by inspecting the project as a whole,
spotting the successes and failures within.  Probits are the more informal
dialogue that we pin to the front of each folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently decided I’d like to take a similar approach to some side projects
that I work on, and also try to apply the methods to some more real-life
situations.  This category, and the accompanying index, below are that attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dropping Gentoo reflex&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html#dropping-gentoo-reflex class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hitting the publish button on &lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html class="reference internal"&gt;&lt;span class=doc&gt;Dropping Gentoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few friends
commented that I was either unnecessarily harsh about Gentoo or we wasted an
enormous amount of time on it.  It definitely was the former, and I feel
a touch ashamed for implying the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was writing my thoughts in the “project obituary” form that I’m used to, and
that is entirely about spotting the downsides to make sure they don’t reoccur.
And with that in mind I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; being incredibly unfair to Gentoo, both the
project and by extension the people working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many, many good points about Gentoo and I’ll nod towards a few now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=speed class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speed&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html#speed class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no.  Not the “Oh my god, my KDEs are so fast” that many people fairly
associate with Gentoo users.  I’m talking about the basic package handling
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few other distributions that can match Gentoo when it comes to
the speed of editing a package.  Or, for that matter, the speed of installation
if you share binary packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the first thing you notice when switching to Debian or Fedora as a heavy
binary package user on Gentoo is just how slow package installation and removal
is.  Binary package installation on Gentoo feels on par with a distribution
like Slackware, and what passes for package management there is just choosing
the right argument to &lt;strong class=command&gt;tar&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;a title="(in Python v3.6)" href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html#cmdoption-trace-C class="reference external"&gt;&lt;code class="xref std std-option docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;-C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Gentoo really excels though is in the speed of creating new packages or
editing existing packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take a look at an example.  Say, for example, that you just found out that
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;flask-dashed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;’s  &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;ebuild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; mistakenly installs a &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;/usr/README&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file.
We we can fix the problem with the following simple change and a call to
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;repoman&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=pre&gt;manifest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the rest takes care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=highlight-diff&gt;&lt;div class=highlight&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=gh&gt;diff --git i/flask-dashed-0.1b_p2.ebuild w/flask-dashed-0.1b_p2.ebuild&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gh&gt;index dd64877a387e..cf3e3cbf272b 100644&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gd&gt;--- i/flask-dashed-0.1b_p2.ebuild&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gi&gt;+++ w/flask-dashed-0.1b_p2.ebuild&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gu&gt;@@ -29,5 +29,6 @@ S="${WORKDIR}/${MY_P}"&lt;/span&gt;

 src_prepare() {
        distutils-r1_src_prepare
&lt;span class=gi&gt;+       sed -i /data_files/d setup.py || die "sed failed"&lt;/span&gt;
        rm -rf "${S}/tests"
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class=admonition-title&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you should fix the package properly and send the fix upstream but
this is just to prove a point.  Calling &lt;strong class=command&gt;die&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong class=command&gt;sed&lt;/strong&gt;
there isn’t recommended and is practically pointless, but it is the style
upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to mention a small downside here however, because very few people seem to
test &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;’s binary package support you’ll occasionally have to do some
leg work to fix problems.  This normally arises when you have an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;eclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
change that needs to ripple through, or when a library breaks compatibility and
its &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;ebuild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; hasn’t been bumped properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every time that happens you can fix it with a quick loop in your shell
though.  A couple of such problems and solutions that I found in my shell
history can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=highlight-zsh&gt;&lt;div class=highlight&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=c1&gt;# When you were stuck with packages that used python-distutils-ng, and you&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=c1&gt;# needed to scrub packages because you changed Python version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=k&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; p in &lt;span class=k&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;portageq pkgdir&lt;span class=k&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/*-*/*.tbz2&lt;span class=p&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=k&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    qtbz2 -xO &lt;span class=nv&gt;$p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=p&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; qxpak -xO - &lt;span class=si&gt;${${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=nv&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=p&gt;##*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=si&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=p&gt;/.tbz2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=si&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.ebuild &lt;span class=p&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep -q &lt;span class=s1&gt;'SUPPORT_PYTHON_ABIS'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=o&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=nb&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=nv&gt;$p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=k&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=c1&gt;# When you were using packages that used python’s “-r1” eclasses and all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=c1&gt;# you could see is a flood of blockages in your update output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=k&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; p in &lt;span class=k&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;portageq pkgdir&lt;span class=k&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/*-*/*.tbz2&lt;span class=p&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=k&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    qtbz2 -xO &lt;span class=nv&gt;$p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=p&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; qxpak -xO - RDEPEND &lt;span class=m&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;/dev/null &lt;span class=p&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep -q &lt;span class=s2&gt;"dev-python/python-exec"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=o&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=nb&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=nv&gt;$p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=k&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=documentation class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html#documentation class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent &lt;a href=http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ class="reference external"&gt;devmanual&lt;/a&gt; and the incredible &lt;a href=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:PMS class="reference external"&gt;Package Manager Specification&lt;/a&gt;
made life so much easier.  The devmanual was both short enough to be used as
quick reference and complete enough that you could learn most of what you’d need
to know from it.  The unfortunately named &lt;abbr title="Package Manager Specification"&gt;PMS&lt;/abbr&gt; acted as the reference that
finally allowed us to switch from away from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; completely at the
office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Package Manager Specification"&gt;PMS&lt;/abbr&gt; documented much of the nastiness that &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; suffers from, and
made life in general a whole lot nicer when you were chasing bugs deep down the
rabbit hole.  And, let us be honest here it also stopped a little of the
fluidity that plagued &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that it acts as unnecessary stop motion but those people must
be forgetting what happened when behaviour changed randomly between &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
versions.  &lt;abbr title="Package Manager Specification"&gt;PMS&lt;/abbr&gt;, and the EAPI process, also brought some much needed design
and stability to newer features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Gentoo users owe Ciaran McCreesh a few beers for all the hard work he put in
to those documents, especially in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=the-personal-touch class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The personal touch&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html#the-personal-touch class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note I’ve met some awesome people over the years as a result of
using Gentoo.  Many of them at the old Gentoo UK conferences, which were always
fun.  More recently at LoFu’s annual summit which seems to have taken Gentoo
UK’s place with practically everyone you saw at Gentoo UK(minus the students),
and oddly about the same Gentoo to non-Gentoo ratio of talks too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two excellent people on our current team were recruited following the Gentoo UK
conference at &lt;abbr title="University College London"&gt;UCL&lt;/abbr&gt;, and we met a spectacular
contract hire at the one prior to that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve even been lucky enough to have a few doors held open for me via people I’ve
met at Gentoo-themed or Gentoo-heavy events, and I suspect I’d be writing this
from a less happy place without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=wrapping-up class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html#wrapping-up class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that you really can not always see the forest for trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had recent events not clouded my vision I would have commented on the train
wreck that is &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;webapp.eclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="file docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;app-admin/webapp-config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html class="reference internal"&gt;&lt;span class=doc&gt;Dropping Gentoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It sucked tonnes and tonnes of time away until we
eventually just trashed any package that interacted with it and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was so long ago that I had forgotten about it until a co-worker asked me
why I hadn’t mentioned it.  I suspect most of the other negative comments I made
will feel equally inconsequential when compared to the benefits Gentoo gave us
as time moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of making this rant even longer, I’ll take the time to reflect on the
fun memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dropping Gentoo&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#dropping-gentoo class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been using &lt;a href=http://gentoo.org class="reference external"&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; for shipped products since June 2005, and as
a development platform since September 2004.  A long time, an incredibly long
time in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today our final Gentoo using product shipped, with a single scheduled update
promised in Q3-2015.  It is kind of sad day, but we all knew that day was coming
and it takes only a little inside knowledge to know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class=admonition-title&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of people have rightly pointed out that I was a little harsh in
this document, so I’ve pushed a &lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo_reflex.html class="reference internal"&gt;&lt;span class=doc&gt;followup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=landscapes-have-changed class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landscapes have changed&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#landscapes-have-changed class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when we started using Gentoo it was clearly the best choice for what we
needed; a easily coercible base on which to construct our Linux devices.  There
actually weren’t a lot of viable choices back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://debian.org class="reference external"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, which many of us loved, felt like the only mainstream distribution we
could have used.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t available for the arches we needed.
It also didn’t package many of things we used at that point, but to be fair
there were &lt;abbr title="Intent to Package"&gt;ITPs&lt;/abbr&gt; (were they called that back then?)
already floating about for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “from source” options available then would, for all intents and purposes,
have meant taking on the support costs of the entire stack which nobody wanted
to commit to.  As it turns out that burden slowly crept up on us over the next
ten years anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=take-a-left-in-100-metres class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take a left in 100 metres&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#take-a-left-in-100-metres class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years we regrettably diverged heavily from upstream, almost to the
point that saying we use Gentoo almost feels like a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before our first product shipped we had already switched to maintaining the
essential toolchain packages like GCC and glibc ourselves.  I can’t recall the
specific reasons as I didn’t work on them, but I recall agreeing with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point we started using a custom package manager, initially just a new
drop-in resolver and eventually a completely independent package manager.
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;portage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was ferociously buggy in places and also appeared to be moribund, so
it seemed like the correct choice.  We never supported the full range of
features that Gentoo’s &lt;a href=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:PMS class="reference external"&gt;PMS&lt;/a&gt; now defines, but it made the support surface a lot
nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a point where we seriously considered moving to a &lt;a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conary_(package_manager) class="reference external"&gt;Conary&lt;/a&gt;-based
infrastructure.  It did loads of the cool things we wanted to do and it mostly
fitted our workflow with its “Gentoo done right” feel.  Sadly, it has
a &lt;abbr title="Contributor License Agreement"&gt;CLA&lt;/abbr&gt; which none of us could sign that practically guaranteed we would
eventually be in the same place we were with Gentoo.  May have been
a fortuitous roadblock in the end, as Conary never gained the traction it
once promised(perhaps in part because of that &lt;abbr title="Contributor License Agreement"&gt;CLA&lt;/abbr&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had we waited another five months, there would have been another open source
package manager for Gentoo we could have easily switched to and hacked on.
There is perhaps a pattern here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=upstreaming-changes class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upstreaming changes&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#upstreaming-changes class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, running a non-standard package manager and a thick layer of custom
packages at the bottom of the stack made contributing changes back upstream very
time consuming.  Many of us tried, but eventually most stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was running Gentoo in the mid-00’s will recall the giant wedge that
got in the way of reporting bugs, and sadly by the time it disappeared many of
us had lost interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had ran the gauntlet and lucked out with a bug in front of a developer,
there was a new barrier that many were irked by: lack of attribution.  It never
bothered me, but the number of developers who wouldn’t even reference a bug
report in the ChangeLog was huge.  That taught me a valuable personal lesson,
I always attribute a commit to the reporter even when I’ve significantly mangled
a patch to make it acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time, to ease the annoyance we used to play a game where we reported real
bugs with patches, but using silly data for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;emerge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=pre&gt;--info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  It was
definitely fun while it lasted, but it didn’t solve the pain points.  Not
wanting to be associated with the bugs made people use pseudonyms, which also
removed the expectation of attribution too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept trying to report trivial and cosmetic bugs - ones which didn’t require
a huge upfront investment - for some time, but they’d go unchanged for weeks or
months so I stopped doing that too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around now there is an automatically generated list of bugs with patches
which we’ve fixed but haven’t upstreamed, and a few random entries from it look
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=highlight-console&gt;&lt;div class=highlight&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=gp&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; wc -l ~/gentoo/to_push/jay.rst
&lt;span class=go&gt;1157 /home/jay/gentoo/to_push/jay.rst&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gp&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; wc -l ~/gentoo/to_push/mattias.rst
&lt;span class=go&gt;2104 /home/jay/gentoo/to_push/mattias.rst&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=gp&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; wc -l ~/gentoo/to_push/chrisp.rst
&lt;span class=go&gt;873 /home/jay/gentoo/to_push/chrisp.rst&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That genuinely upsets me greatly.  The amount of potential duplicated effort
they represent is enormous, and I don’t even want to attempt to put a figure on
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=supporting-upstream class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting upstream&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#supporting-upstream class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re entirely to blame.  We always planned on supporting upstream in whichever
way we could.  That fell down for instances beyond sending patches too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story that comes to mind is from a chance encounter at LinuxWorld back in
2005.  We had managed to gather a whole heap of really cool hardware to donate
to projects who were exhibiting on the day we attended, and it felt nice handing
out toys as a little “thank you” to the projects we depended on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all roses though.  My manager went off to offer some ARM-based devices
to the Gentoo guys who were there, but was met with “tremendous rudeness” from
the person manning their desk at the time.  In hindsight people could have
predicted a similar outcome, and it was just an unlucky moment for him to walk
up.  That soured his enthusiasm no end, and it was the last time we managed to
score bags of toys to randomly give away to developers on any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were one of the people who received a Nokia tablet or ZipIt in the Hand
&amp;amp; Flower that evening, you now know the reason and perhaps you can even guess
who to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I watched a similar scenario play out at the Gentoo UK
conference with a potential sponsor and the same developer.  Evening beers were
met with other people telling stories about that same person, which was a shame
as it probably cost them a few good cash and infrastructure sponsors that day
alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=support-costs class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support costs&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#support-costs class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time we’ve come to support most of the tree that people refer to as
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;gentoo-x86&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ourselves.  The toolchain changes we needed at the time
necessitated supporting a few packages further up the stack.  Our desire to trim
the tree of a few categories that were problematic, meant replacing a variety of
packages with then unavailable dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were many other examples too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=matchbox class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;matchbox&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#matchbox class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We packaged &lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#matchbox class="reference internal"&gt;matchbox&lt;/a&gt; and its associated packages a long, long time before they
hit the official tree.  It was the first real pain point we had with packages
appearing in the tree after we had already been using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they did eventually hit the tree we had to carry workarounds for years.  At
some point we stopped trying and just scrubbed the ebuilds that got in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=python class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#python class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of the Python packaging a few years ago made us take the jump to
replace or remove anything that packaged a Python module.  Initially very time
consuming, but it saved an enormous amount of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect we could move closer to upstream at this point, but the point is now
moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=systemd class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;systemd&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#systemd class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We switched to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;systemd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the package was in upstream’s tree, and we
have had to keep supporting it to this day because of insurmountable packaging
differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few places that means taking on packages with a reverse dependency too,
where differences create issues.  And it clearly means taking on any package
that depends on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;openrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or Gentoo’s &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;baselayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; package.  Those packages
are becoming fewer and fewer by the day though, so that would have become
a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=x-org class=section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;X.org&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#x-org class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been packaging x.org’s packages to work around some implementation
differences with upstream since the dawn of modular X.  Mostly just to do with
how dependencies were specified to start with, but they’re no longer even
remotely similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there isn’t a great deal of churn in the packages we care about for the
most part, so it never caused a huge time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=the-end-is-nigh class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end is nigh&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#the-end-is-nigh class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it began to feel like we were maintaining our own distribution
from end-to-end, and that wasn’t fun.  It also wasn’t what any of us needed to
do, and the time it was taking measurably ate in to &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; project time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to start weaning ourselves off of Gentoo was made back in the
summer of last year, and it has finally started to come in to effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=the-times-they-are-a-changing class=section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Times They Are a-Changing&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/articles/dropping_gentoo.html#the-times-they-are-a-changing class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good alternatives out there now for building systems that
need to run on a variety of architectures.  Some binary, some source-based and
a few hybrid approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I’m working on right now is using Debian &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class=pre&gt;testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and it appears
to be working out fine.  Some things still annoy me, like the time it takes to
patch and recreate a package.  It is a trivial thing with Gentoo, but requires
far too much work with Debian.  Perhaps we’ll improve the workflow enough as we
develop more experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also hit a good moment to use Debian because a whole heap of work has gone
in to making Debian easier to bootstrap, and it definitely shows.  When I find
out who has done all the magic to make that happen I’ll scribble down a note to
owe them some beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also lucky in that we employ two Debian developers, one is practically
a funded full-time Debian developer.  They’re incredibly knowledgeable and it
makes working with Debian a lot easier, so thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, things look good.  We’re still playing with some alternatives and as
yet no concrete decisions have been made, but I feel like we’re on the right
track for the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So long Gentoo, and thanks for all fish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Delayed flashover&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/delayed_flashover.html#delayed-flashover class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend a very good friend of mine is taking part in the London Marathon,
and we’re all looking forward to the no-doubt incredible time she’ll finish in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=epigraph&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fun run” is the excuse losers give &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I wouldn’t bother writing anything about such an event but this is
different.  It is different because she is practically a hero to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about Rach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer she gave birth to a bouncing baby girl&lt;a id=id1 href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/delayed_flashover.html#s1 class="footnote-reference brackets"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven months later she is going to complete a marathon.  I would say “planning
to complete”, but I know better at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is made all the more impressive because a decade ago we thought we’d lose
her following a serious accident.  As time went on and things improved the
realisation that we’d have a wheelchair-bound-for-life friend kicked in.  And
slowly it became clear that we’d have a crutch-bound-for-life friend.  And
eventually it became quite obvious we’d have a soul-filling running machine to
envy once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now she has been lucky, very lucky.  But we make our own luck too, and she is an
awesome luck making machine.  To poorly misuse a Pasteur quote that I already
tend to overuse, “luck favours the prepared mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have one tip for the Dear Reader this week it is this: Keep your
sponsorship options in check, she’ll destroy the target time.  Go Rach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class=admonition-title&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Sub-four finish, ‘nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=rubric&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt id=s1 class=label&gt;&lt;span class=brackets&gt;&lt;a href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/delayed_flashover.html#id1 class=fn-backref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;a term which always make me think I should call child services&lt;a id=id2 href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/delayed_flashover.html#s2 class="footnote-reference brackets"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;a term which makes me think they bring fizzy drinks and sugary cakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hitting life’s reset button&lt;a title="Permalink to this headline" href=https://jnrowe.github.io/thoughts/reset_in_ten.html#hitting-lifes-reset-button class=headerlink&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven months ago while enjoying a little Saturday afternoon cricket picnic,
a friend posed the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If life had a reset button when would you have used it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand the point and the purpose of this.  Catherine was hoping to
elicit some deep truths, with the eventual goal that people would bond further.
That doesn’t mean I played the game though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall my answer was somewhat flippant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d have used it repeatedly half an hour ago, until I figured out the magic
incantation that convinces that cashier in the ‘Express to join me for
a picnic… and then I would have ditched you suckers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an honest-ish answer;  I mean yeah, she may have been worth messing with
the universe for.  It wasn’t, however, the correct kind of reply.  I should
have been describing some dreadful mistake I made, both to make my friends
laugh and also to let them in a little closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t choose to answer that way to be deliberately obtuse, I answered
that way simply because it was how I felt at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, and I direct you to the first three words of this post, I’ve been
mildly obsessed with the question.  I have a twenty heading document where I’ve
described branch points in my life, specifically the ones with the deepest joy
and most painful regrets.  I hoped I’d see a pattern of some kind, and that
would allow me to direct myself toward the happier paths in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t, and it hasn’t.  Not even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t seem to find myself in the situations where I could repeat the most
foolish decisions that I really regret.  And I wonder whether that is because
I’ve eventually been smart enough to learn my lessons, or stupid enough that
I’m unable to spot the new mistakes yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process has been very cathartic though. Despite having
a &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; higher proportion of regrets than successes in my list,
I kind of enjoying reviewing it in a cringe ridden way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d really like to thank Catherine for offering the mirror, it has been
intriguing in a terrifying and horrific kind of way.  Unfortunately, I can’t.
It is too late, and there is another lesson for me to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=docutils&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, that girl still works at the ‘Express and I’ve done
nothing useful about it.  Internet, this is the foolish truth I proffer you
today.  The others well, they’ll hopefully remain hidden away from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
