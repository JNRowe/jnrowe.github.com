This weekend a very good friend of mine is taking part in the London Marathon,
and we’re all looking forward to the no-doubt incredible time she’ll finish in.

.. epigraph::

    “Fun run” is the excuse losers give *before* a race

Normally, I wouldn’t bother writing anything about such an event but this is
different.  It is different because she is practically a hero to me.

I’m talking about Rach.

Last summer she gave birth to a bouncing baby girl [#s1]_.

Seven months later she is going to complete a marathon.  I would say “planning
to complete”, but I know better at this point.

This is made all the more impressive because a decade ago we thought we’d lose
her following a serious accident.  As time went on and things improved the
realisation that we’d have a wheelchair-bound-for-life friend kicked in.  And
slowly it became clear that we’d have a crutch-bound-for-life friend.  And
eventually it became quite obvious we’d have a soul-filling running machine to
envy once again.

Now she has been lucky, very lucky.  But we make our own luck too, and she is an
awesome luck making machine.  To poorly misuse a Pasteur quote that I already
tend to overuse, “luck favours the prepared mind.”

If I have one tip for the Dear Reader this week it is this: Keep your
sponsorship options in check, she’ll destroy the target time.  Go Rach!

.. note::

   **Update**: Sub-four finish, ‘nuff said.
