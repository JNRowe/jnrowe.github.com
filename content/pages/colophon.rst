:summary: How this site is built

This site is built with pelican_, the awesome static site generator.  You can
view the `git repository`_ of this site to see how it works in practice.

Content creation
----------------

Content is invariably written with vim_, or on occasion via a script, in the
beautiful reST_ format.

And finally…
------------

I’d like to believe that all my pages are valid :abbr:`HTML (HyperText Markup
Language)` and :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`, and that all my feeds are
valid Atom_.  Web standards are important, and I try to stick to them.  Check
the content against validators if you wish, and shame me if I’ve failed :)
