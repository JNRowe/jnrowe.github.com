h2. {{ page.title }}

h3. Introduction

This site is built with "jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, Tom Preston-Werner's absolutely fantastic static site builder.  You can fork the "content":http://github.com/JNRowe/jnrowe.github.com of this site to see how it works in practise.

h3. Content creation

Content is invariably written with "vim":http://www.vim.org/ in the textile format, although only because jekyll doesn't support "reST":http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/.

h3. And finally...

I'd like to believe that all my pages are valid XHTML(eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets), and that all my feeds are valid "Atom":http://www.atomenabled.org/.  Web standards are important, and I try to stick to them.  Check the content against validators if you wish, and shame me if I've failed :)
