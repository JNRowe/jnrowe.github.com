JNRowe's User Pages
===================

This is the repository of my personal pages and blog, mostly the stuff
I'm unable to host at work for some contractual reason.

They're built automatically using Jekyll_ when I push the repository to
GitHub_.  It's a pretty cool system and you should try it for yourself
if you haven't already!

The content of this site, that is files under ``posts/`` and
``drafts/``, is licensed under the `Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license`_.  The rest of this repository is
licensed under the `GPL version 3`_.

If you find any problems with this repository either drop me an email_
or file an issue_.  Locally bugs are managed with `Bugs Everywhere`_, so
if you're working with a clone of the repository you can report, list
and fix bugs directly from the source tree [#]_ .

.. [#] There is a Git mirror of `Bugs Everywhere`_ available at
       http://github.com/JNRowe/Bugs-Everywhere .
