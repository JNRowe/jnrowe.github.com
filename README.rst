JNRowe's User Pages
===================

This is the repository of my personal pages and blog, mostly the stuff I'm
unable to host at work for some contractual reason.

They're built automatically using Jekyll_ when I push the repository to GitHub_.
It's a pretty cool system and you should try it for yourself if you haven't
already!

If you find any problems with this repository either file an issue_ or drop me
an email_.
