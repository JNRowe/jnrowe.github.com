<h1>Side-projects<a class="headerlink" href="#side-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Chatting with my brother yesterday he expressed some disbelief when I mentioned
<em>yet another</em> friend who has a website related to some topic we were discussing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Does everyone you know run a website?</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes, they do.</p>
<p>It hadn&#8217;t really occurred to me until I was reading a write up of a co-workers
weekend hack.  The majority of nerdy people I know run websites, create
iPhone/android apps or have other side projects in various states of completion.
It&#8217;s just How Things Work®</p>
<p>I guess it is mostly a cultural issue, one which is quite strong behind the
engineering side of the curtain in my workplace.  Sure, there are some &#8220;5:01&#8221;
types who are out of the door as soon as the bell rings, but there are an awful
lot who extend their tech creations in to a downtime hobby or side business.</p>
<p>To relate this to my brother I think of a family party we attended this past
weekend.  When people asked me what my brother does I proudly say he works in
logistics, and I like to tell people how well he&#8217;s done for himself.  When
talking to the extended family that often seemed to end up being about material
possessions or such.  However, I&#8217;ve noticed in the past when I&#8217;m talking to
people I&#8217;d call friends it often quickly digresses in to strange discussions
about box packing, routing, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">the curse of travelling salesmen</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridges_of_Konigsberg">bridges in
a foreign land</a>.  Because of the math and technology implications many of my
friends have written tools to explore some of the practical and theoretical
issues faced in logistics… for fun.</p>
<div class="section" id="it-is-all-about-me">
<h2>It is all about me<a class="headerlink" href="#it-is-all-about-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not working on any public facing websites right now <a class="footnote-reference" href="#s1" id="id1">[1]</a>, but I do play
with a few public facing projects from time to time that should head towards
proving my point.  I&#8217;m picking a few semi-randomly to illustrate a little
diversity.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">To save myself some researching effort I&#8217;ll only link to things from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JNRowe/">my
GitHub profile</a> or links from my browser&#8217;s bookmarks, but that should be
descriptive enough to get the point across.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gentoo">
<h3>Gentoo<a class="headerlink" href="#gentoo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Over the past decade I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time hacking on things related to
<a class="reference external" href="http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.  Some of that for work projects and some of it for <a class="reference external" href="https://jnrowe-misc.rtfd.org/">personal
projects</a>.  I&#8217;ve also experienced my fair share of troubles, and have <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?email1=jnrowe%40gmail.com&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;emailcc1=1&amp;emaillongdesc1=1&amp;emailreporter1=1&amp;emailtype1=substring&amp;query_format=advanced">reported
a few bugs</a>.</p>
<p>At one time I even hoped to <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142090">become a developer</a>, but that didn&#8217;t work out for
a bunch of reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="github2">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">github2</span></tt><a class="headerlink" href="#github2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For a year I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ask/python-github2/graphs/contributors">maintained</a> a relatively popular <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ask/python-github2">API wrapper</a> to GitHub.  I did
this because I found it fun.  It provided no economic benefit to me, and I never
expected it to.  I know a lot of people used it when building their own toy
projects and websites, because many were kind enough to link to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pyisbn">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyisbn</span></tt><a class="headerlink" href="#pyisbn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For seven years I&#8217;ve maintained a small library for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JNRowe/pyisbn/">validating ISBNs</a>.
<em>Yes, that is absolutely as boring as it sounds</em>.</p>
<p>It was never meant to be used by others, I just needed something to validate
entries in my e-book database.  Other people started using it, many for their
own weird side projects including a number of book retail websites.  It has
amassed literally tens of thousands of downloads from PyPI, but you really
shouldn&#8217;t trust the dubious statistics from PyPI ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rdial">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rdial</span></tt><a class="headerlink" href="#rdial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://rdial.rtfd.org/">rdial</a> is a time tracking tool, and a perfect example for me.  I played with it
for over a year before anyone else saw it, just because it scratched an itch
I had.  I never imagined it would be useful to others.  Turns out it was, and
there is now a small yet faithful band of users.</p>
<p>I even received the great honour of a few summer evening beers for releasing it.
A beer being second only to a patch in the table of project endorsements
that I subscribe to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upoints">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upoints</span></tt><a class="headerlink" href="#upoints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://jnrowe.github.com/upoints/">upoints</a> is a strange one.  It started as a <a class="reference external" href="http://jnrowe.github.io/upoints/geolocation_and_pathcross.html">stupid hack</a> to figure out some
silly travel planning drama, it proceeded to take on a life of its own.  Over
the years it attracted a fair amount of users, and I still receive email about
it now.</p>
<p>It did have some tangible benefit though, the sadly now defunct website it
eventually spawned opened some nice doors for me.  I didn&#8217;t know it would or
could at the time, so it didn&#8217;t affect how I spent my time when playing with it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cut-from-the-pattern">
<h2>Cut from the pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#cut-from-the-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This isn&#8217;t specific to me, or even to the particularly nerdy among my
co-workers.  If you <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/explore">dig around on GitHub</a>, or even <a class="reference external" href="http://makezine.com/">makezine</a>, you&#8217;ll see
people creating purely because they can.  This isn&#8217;t a new phenomenon either.
If you were around pre-GitHub you&#8217;d see people making things on Sourceforge.  If
you were around before Sourceforge, you&#8217;ll remember the good old days when life
was simpler and people held doors open for you.</p>
<p>The point is simple.  Yes, I <em>may</em> know someone who is working on
project/website related to some topic, but that is only because many of the
people I know are spitting out new projects on what often appears to be a weekly
basis.</p>
