Populating :command:`sup` contacts from abook
=============================================

A colleague from work, Adam Robertson, is switching to Sup_ from mutt_ and
wondering how to easily convert his contacts from abook_.  Given that it is my
constant pimping of :command:`sup` that has convinced him to switch I feel
obliged to help with the conversion.

The first choice I may recommend is just to follow the wiki_ and use
:command:`abook` as a source for lbdb_.  I use a method similar to this quite
successfully.

The second choice is to prime the contact list from :command:`abook` with
a little Python_ script.  The :command:`sup` contacts list uses a `very simple
format`_ and mangling the :command:`abook` addressbook is possible in only
a few lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

    #! /usr/bin/python3 -tt
    """Generate a sup contacts list from abook"""

    from os import path
    from sys import argv, exit

    from configobj import ConfigObj

    def parse(fname=None):
        if not fname:
            fname = path.expanduser('~/.abook/addressbook')
        conf = ConfigObj(fname, list_values=False)
        for chunk in filter(lambda d: 'nick' in d and 'email' in d, conf.values()):
            print('{0[nick]}: {0[name]}'.format(chunk),
                  '<{}>'.format(chunk['email'].split(',')[0]))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        if len(argv) > 1:
            if argv[1] in ('-h', '--help'):
                print('{} [addressbook]'.format(argv[0]))
                exit(255)
            addressbook = argv[1]
        else:
            addressbook = None
        parse(addressbook)

The script requires the excellent configobj_ module.  You could also use the
:mod:`configparser` module from the Python standard library, but ``configobj``
allows my laziness to shine through with its simple dictionary-based access to
the parsed data.

The script opens either the named or default :command:`abook` addressbook and
fetches any entries that contain both a ``nick`` and ``email`` section.  Those
entries are then output in format that :command:`sup` accepts.  It includes
only the primary email address for the contact, as I tend to order contacts
with multiple email addresses in address preference order.

As Iâ€™ve mentioned before in :doc:`Making_a_nice_home` all these tasks should be
automated, and this one is no different.  To regenerate the contacts list when
the addressbook has been updated we can use make_:

.. code-block:: make

    .sup/contacts.txt: .abook/addressbook
        python3 sup_contacts.py $< >$@

Using this method allows us to continue using :command:`abook` while having
simple access to our contacts from within :command:`sup`.  This is incredibly
useful as it means we can continue to use :command:`abook` for other things
too, see :doc:`Kick_me_birthday_reminders`.
