<h1>Hitting life&#8217;s reset button<a class="headerlink" href="#hitting-life-s-reset-button" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Seven months ago while enjoying a little Saturday afternoon cricket picnic,
a friend posed the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;If life had a reset button when would you have used it?&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, I understand the point and the purpose of this.  Catherine was hoping to
elicit some deep truths, with the eventual goal that people would bond further.
That doesn&#8217;t mean I played the game though.</p>
<p>I recall my answer was somewhat flippant:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;I&#8217;d have used it repeatedly half an ago, until I figured out the magic
incantation that convinces that cashier in the &#8216;Express to join me for
a picnic...  and then I would have ditched you suckers.&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>It was an honest-ish answer;  I mean yeah, she may have been worth messing with
the universe for.  It wasn&#8217;t, however, the correct kind of reply.  I should
have been describing some dreadful mistake I made, both to make my friends
laugh and also to let them in a little closer.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose to answer that way to be deliberately obtuse, I answered
that way simply because it was how I felt at the time.</p>
<p>Since then, and I direct you to the first three words of this post, I&#8217;ve been
mildly obsessed with the question.  I have a twenty heading document where I&#8217;ve
described branch points in my life, specifically the ones with the deepest joy
and most painful regrets.  I hoped I&#8217;d see a pattern of some kind, and that
would allow me to direct myself toward the happier paths in future.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t, and it hasn&#8217;t.  Not even a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t seem to find myself in the situations where I could repeat the most
foolish decisions that I really regret.  And I wonder whether that is because
I&#8217;ve eventually been smart enough to learn my lessons, or stupid enough that
I&#8217;m unable to spot the new mistakes yet.</p>
<p>The whole process has been very cathartic though. Despite having
a <em>significantly</em> higher proportion of regrets than successes in my list,
I kind of enjoying reviewing it in a cringe ridden way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to thank Catherine for offering the mirror, it has been
intriguing in a terrifying and horrific kind of way.  Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t.
It is too late, and there is another lesson for me to learn.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, that girl still works at the &#8216;Express and I&#8217;ve done
nothing useful about it.  Internet, this is the foolish truth I proffer you
today.  The others well, they&#8217;ll hopefully remain hidden away from view.</p>
