:description: How this site is built

This site is built with Sphinx_, Georg Brandl's absolutely fantastic
documentation tool.  You can fork the content_ of this site to see how it works
in practise.

Content creation
----------------

Content is invariably written with vim_, or on occasion via a script, in the
beautiful reST_ format.

And finally...
--------------

I'd like to believe that all my pages are valid
:abbr:`XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language)` and
:abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`, and that all my feeds are valid Atom_.
Web standards are important, and I try to stick to them.  Check the content
against validators if you wish, and shame me if I've failed :)
