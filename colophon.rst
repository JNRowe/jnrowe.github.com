:description: How this site is built

This site is built with Sphinx_, Georg Brandl's absolutely fantastic
documentation tool.  You can fork the content_ of this site to see how it works
in practise.

Content creation
----------------

Content is invariably written with emacs_, or on occasion via a script, in the
beautiful reST_ format.
