:description: How this site is built

This site is built with Sphinx_, Georg Brandl's absolutely fantastic
documentation tool.  You can view the `git repository`_ of this site to see how
it works in practice.

Content creation
----------------

Content is invariably written with vim_, or on occasion via a script, in the
beautiful reST_ format.

And finally...
--------------

I'd like to believe that all my pages are valid :abbr:`XHTML (eXtensible
HyperText Markup Language)` and :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`, and that
all my feeds are valid Atom_.  Web standards are important, and I try to stick
to them.  Check the content against validators if you wish, and shame me if I've
failed :)
